Simulation Project

This project was created using codeblocks and c++.

The idea was to create a simulation of the Monty Hall problem.  As of right now, it works through the windows shell.
It can be ran in two ways

1. A single simulation, to display wether or not the program works.

2.  Several simulations based on user input, where the results (wins + losses) are shown on screen.
